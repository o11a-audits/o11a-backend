# To-Do
- Add an endpoint to get the original source of a source topic (a function, a struct definition, a statement, etc) so the user can verify that the formatted version did not miss any information. Include some lines above it to show heading comments. This endpoint can probably do a full read to disk for each request, so no need to be preprocessed, but it will require the either the back end to keep track of a source topic's SourceLocation in the code, or the front end to keep track of it.
- Make formatter indent divs have an automatic newline at the beginning, but not at the end. Commas need to be placed at the end of expressions no matter the indent and will need to be placed after whatever expression is passed to a function arg.
