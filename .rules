Before any task:
1. Explore the project first. List out all project files and the functions within them to understand the project structure and the existing codebase.
2. Before adding a new type or function, check if it is already defined in the codebase. If so, try to use or adapt it to the new use case

Before completing any task:
1. Always run diagnostics to check for compilation errors
2. Fix any errors before considering the task complete
3. Check your work for best practices, and suggest improvements if any
4. Do not add tests
5. Do not run terminal commands

This is a rust project. Prefer standalone functions over methods implemented on types.
